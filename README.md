GitRanks turns public GitHub activity into an easy "developer scoreboard". See how you stack up globally or in your own country, discover emerging developers, and track progress as it updates **daily**.

## 🧠 Why?

I wanted a clear, fun way to contextualize my open‑source work— *“Am I growing? Where do I stand locally? Who’s up‑and‑coming?”* Existing tools felt either too noisy or too stale. So I built GitRanks.
