# GitRanks UI

[gitranks.com](https://gitranks.com) is the first web application that reveals **GitHub profile rankings** across three core dimensions:

- ⭐ **Owned repositories** by total stars
- 🧑‍💻 **Contributions** to external repositories
- 🧲 **Followers** compared to other developers

It was built to provide meaningful insights into a developer's impact on GitHub — going beyond simple contribution graphs and surfacing how you rank globally in each area. Whether you're an open-source maintainer, a prolific contributor, or growing your audience — **GitRanks gives your work the visibility it deserves**.

## 🎖️ Badges

Generate a GitHub badge for your profile at [gitranks.com/badge](https://gitranks.com/badge) and showcase your rank in stars, contributions, or followers — perfect for your README or portfolio.
